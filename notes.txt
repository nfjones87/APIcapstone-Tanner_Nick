As a user, the first page I see contains the title of the website, and a question. The question being "Who are you?" the possible answers being "cosplayer, ect"
As a user, the next page I see is a nice and large search bar prompting me to input the fandom i am looking for. 
As a user, I can type in a fandom/movie/tv show and submit, and receive a list of Etsy store related items
As a user, when I search, I start to hear a related movie soundtrack (if available)
As a user, when I search, the page background/theme changes depending on certain searches
As a user, I can select an item from the search results and it brings them to the etsy page (maybe more, depending on API limits).

User seaches for a movie related topic on Etsy, and while they search for that, the soundtrack of the movie pops up to be played while searching.
User can select what they're looking for through a drop down selector. "I am a: (cosplayer, prop collector, normie)"



Backburner:
	 when a user searches for a certain movie, it changes all the colors of the page to colors that are related to that movie.
